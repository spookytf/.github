# spooky.tf
We're building the next big thing in terms of an integrated TF2 community experience. Automating what can be automated ethically, and leaving the rest to good old humans, our servers and our websites will aim to provide the best prices, feature-sets, and community benefits available. **Thank you for spooking with us!**

### our domain aliases
_any domain other than these IS NOT OURS!_  
- `spooky.tf` 
- `boo.tf`
- `spookytf.com`

#### ***BE CAREFUL WHEN TRADING!***


## directives
These are some of the distinct projects that the spooky.tf team is undertaking.
- [spooky.tf](https://github.com/zudsniper/spookytf)
    This will be our main focus for the foreseeable future of the project. We plan to bring reasonable buy & sell prices even when examined thoroughly by the most seasoned of traders, all without sacrificing any user experience. (Any one should be able to use it!)
- [stf-discord-bot](https://github.com/zudsniper/stf-discord-bot)
    The discord bot is simply an integration that will add some additional functionality to our [home discord server](https://spooky.tf/discord/), as well some other features yet to be announced. 
- `trade_spookytf` custom trade map!
    This is an entirely custom designed trade map developed by experienced developer @Pigzit, and will feature a sprawling spawn manor, creepy gardens, bridges, chandeliers, and (well obviously) GHOSTS! 
- `stf-sm-*` custom sourcemod plugin(s)
    These plugins will faciliate some features of our custom trade map as well as other features yet to be announced.
