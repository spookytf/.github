# a `WIP` spell marketplace with massive ambitions
We're building the next big thing in terms of an integrated TF2 community experience. Automating what can be automated ethically, and leaving the rest to good old humans, our servers and our websites will aim to provide the best prices, feature-sets, and community benefits available. **Thank you for spooking with us!**

> **UPDATE 1/13/2022**  
> There have been significant delays in the production process due to a fullstack rewrite to switch from a monolithic to a microservices-based paradigm for our backend.   
> I personally apologize for the extra time spent, but I wouldn't have OK'd it if I didn't think it was necessary. We want to have _the best_ backend of a Steam bot service -- which of course we won't, but that's my level of aspiration / delusion -- and I'm willing to sacrifice more time before launching MVP in favor of a more scalable backend. I hope you understand.

## [`spooky.tf`](https://github.com/spookytf/spookytf)  
This will be our main focus for the foreseeable future of the project. We plan to bring reasonable buy & sell prices even when examined thoroughly by the most seasoned of traders, all without sacrificing any user experience. (Any one should be able to use it!)

## `trade_spookytf` custom trade map!  
`THIS SERVER WILL BE LIVE AFTER JANUARY 20th!`  
This is an entirely custom designed trade map developed by experienced developer @Pigzit, and features a sprawling spawn manor, creepy gardens, bridges, chandeliers, and (well obviously) GHOSTS!
