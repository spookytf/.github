# a `WIP` spell marketplace with massive ambitions
We're building the next big thing in terms of an integrated TF2 community experience. Automating what can be automated ethically, and leaving the rest to good old humans, our servers and our websites will aim to provide the best prices, feature-sets, and community benefits available. **Thank you for spooking with us!**

# directives
These are some of the distinct projects that the spooky.tf team is undertaking.
## [`spooky.tf`](https://github.com/zudsniper/spookytf)  
This will be our main focus for the foreseeable future of the project. We plan to bring reasonable buy & sell prices even when examined thoroughly by the most seasoned of traders, all without sacrificing any user experience. (Any one should be able to use it!)
